# HTML

HTML -  Hypertext Markup Language, is a backbone of the web designing world.

### 1. Introduction

HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is a fundamental language for web pages. It provides the structure and content of web documents and is crucial for the proper rendering of information on the internet.

### 2. HTML Basics
#### 2.1. Syntax

HTML documents consist of elements enclosed in tags. eg :- `<tagname>`. Elements can be nested, creating a hierarchical structure. Common elements include headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```


#### 2.2. Document Structure

- `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration: Specifies the HTML version being used.
- `<html>`: The root element of the document.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information like title, character set, and linked stylesheets.
- `<body>`: Holds the visible content of the web page.

### 3. HTML5: The Latest Standard

HTML5, the fifth and latest version of HTML, introduced numerous new features and elements, including:

- `<header>` and `<footer>`: Semantically define the top and bottom sections of a page.
- `<nav>`: Represents a navigation menu.
- `<article>`: Encloses independent, self-contained content.
- `<section>`: Groups related content within an article.
- `<canvas>`: Allows for dynamic rendering of graphics and animations.
- `<video>` and `<audio>`: Embed multimedia content directly.

### 4. Formatting style

To ensure well-structured and maintainable code, web developers should follow best practices, such as:

- Semantic HTML: Use appropriate tags to represent content meaningfully.
- Validity: Ensure the HTML code complies with W3C standards.
