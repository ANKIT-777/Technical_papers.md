# Python

- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design makes code readability very easy.
- Python is often used as a general-purpose programming language for web development, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
 
## Data Types 
-  *Numbers*: Python supports both integer and floating-point numbers ex :- number = 10

 *Numbers (integers and floats):**
1. Arithmetic Operations: Basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Modulus Operator (%): Finds the remainder of a division.
3. Power Operator (**): Calculates exponentiation.
4. Comparison Operators: Compares numbers using operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.
5. Methods: `abs()` for absolute value, `round()` for rounding, `int()` or `float()` for type conversion.

  
-  *Strings*: Strings are sequences of characters ex :- string = "hello"

**Strings:**
1. Concatenation: Joining strings together using the `+` operator.
2. Indexing and Slicing: Accessing individual characters or substrings.
3. Methods: `len()` for string length, `upper()` and `lower()` for case conversion, `strip()` for whitespace removal, and more.
4. String Formatting: Use `format()` or f-strings for variable insertion.
5. Manipulation: Methods like `replace()`, `find()`, and `count()` for string modifications.

-  *Booleans*: Booleans are logical values that can be either True or False. ex :- boolean = True/False

**Booleans:**
1. Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, and `not` for combining or negating boolean values.

  
## Important data types
-  **Lists**: Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type.
  ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']
  ```
- **Tuples**: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
  ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')
  ```
**Lists and Tuples:**
1. Indexing and Slicing: Access elements by position.
2. Methods: `append()` to add elements, `remove()` to delete elements, `pop()` to remove and return, and more.
3. Functions: `len()` for length, `count()` for element occurrences.
4. Tuple-specific: `index()` to find an element's index in a tuple.

   
- **Dictionaries**: Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. 
  ```python
  my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
  ```
  **Dictionaries:**
1. Key-Value Access: Retrieve values using keys.
2. Methods: `keys()` for keys, `values()` for values, and `items()` for key-value pairs.
3. Utility: `get()` for safe value access, `pop()` for key removal.

- **Sets**: Sets are unordered collections of unique items.
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}  
  ```
  **Sets:**
  1. Set Operations: Union, intersection, difference, etc.
  2. Methods: `add()` to include elements, `remove()` to delete, `discard()` without errors, and `clear()` to clear all elements.
